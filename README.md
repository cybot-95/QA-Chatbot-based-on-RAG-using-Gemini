## RAG-based QA Chatbot with Gemini 1.5 Flash and Pinecone DB ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash large language model (LLM) and Pinecone's vector database. This chatbot leverages the strengths of both components:

* **Gemini 1.5 Flash:** Delivers powerful text generation capabilities with a long context window and multilingual support.
* **Pinecone DB:** Efficiently stores and retrieves relevant information from a provided PDF document, enabling the chatbot to access and answer questions based on its content.

**Key Feature:**

The chatbot is specifically designed to only answer questions based on the information contained within a provided PDF document. This ensures focused, accurate responses relevant to the specific knowledge source.
